Outline:
  
  Purpose:
    I want to create a website that will allow people to anonymously upload and comment on photos. There may also be a ranking system to allow people to vote the pictures up and down.

  Pages: 
    There needs to be, at least, a main page that talks about what the website does, a page for people to upload the images, a page that allows people to veiw the pictures as a list or grid or something, and then an automatically generated page for each picture that contains the comments and the commenting system.

  Database:
    The database needs to do a couple of things. It needs to store the images (and all related data) and the comments (and all related data).
    
      Images: link to the picture, 
              date/time uploaded,
              title,

    Comments: text of comment,
              date/time posted,
              image the comment belongs to
